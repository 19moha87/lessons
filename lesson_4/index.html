      <div class="text">

         <p>
            Apple. A low-calorie snack, high in both soluble and insoluble fiber. Nutrition experts claim one large
            apple
            has around 130 calories, and none come from fat. Apples also have no sodium or cholesterol—nutrients many
            want
            to expressly avoid. One apple has 34 grams of carbohydrates, 25 grams of which come from the fruit’s natural
            sugars.
         </p>

         <p>
            Lisa Sefcik, in an article, wrote: “One apple gives you 20 percent of your daily value [DV] of fiber. You
            also
            get 2 percent of your DV of vitamin A, iron and calcium, and 8 percent of your DV of vitamin C. Almost half
            of
            the fruit’s vitamin C content is within the skin, so it’s best to eat apples unpeeled. Apple skins are a
            valuable source of the fruit’s fiber and also contain pectin.”
         </p>

         <p>
            Looking for something to help you lose some weight? Try eating apple, which may help to increase weight
            loss,
            according to a study involving about 400 women in Brazil. Women ate either apples or oat cookies for a
            period
            of 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the researchers found that the women who consumed the apples had a significant
            weight loss of 1.21 kilograms, while the group of women who ate the oat cookies showed no significant weight
            loss.

      <h3 id="avocado">2.Avocado</h3>
      <img src="img/avocado.img" alt="avocado">
      <div class="text">
         <p>
            Avocado. The most nutritious fruit in the world. The reason, according to Health Online Zine, is that the
            fruit
            “contains in excess of 25 essential nutrients, including vitamins A, B, C, E and K, copper, iron,
            phosphorus,
            magnesium and potassium.”
         </p>

         <p>
            Avocado also contains fiber, protein and beneficial phytochemicals, such as beta-sitosterol, glutathione and
            lutein, which help protect against various diseases and illnesses. In addition, “avocado is one of the high-
            calorie fruits that you could be eating. This is due to its larger amounts of fat content, approximately 20
            times the average of other fruits.”
         </p>

         <p>
            Nutritionists claim avocados contain goodly amounts of vitamin C (necessary for the production of collagen
            needed for the growth of new cells and tissues which prevents viruses from penetrating cell membranes, and
            also
            a powerful antioxidant), thiamine (converts carbohydrates to glucose to fuel the brain and nervous system)
            and
            riboflavin (helps the body to release energy from proteins, carbohydrates and fat).
         </p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="banana">3.Banana</h3>
      <img src="img/banana.img" alt="banana">
      <div class="text">
         <p>
            Banana. “In one form or another, raw or cooked, more bananas are consumed daily than perhaps any other fruit
            in the world.” That’s what the book, Tropical and Subtropical Agriculture, states.
         </p>

         <p>
            Unknowingly, banana is one of the most healthful fruits the world has known. Alexander the Great was so
            fascinated by the virtues of this fruit that he described it as “the heavenly fruit that tasted like nectar
            sweetened in honey.”
         </p>

         <p>
            Health experts claim that banana is low in protein, free of fats but high in energy. A fully ripe banana has
            20
            percent to 25 percent sugar. It has a significant amount of B-vitamins, especially B1 and B6. B1 is a brain
            tonic, whereas B6 relieves, in particular, uncomfortable symptoms of the pre-menstrual tension syndrome like
            irritability, headaches, tender breasts and water retention.

         </p>
         <p>
            “One medium-sized banana boasts of 100 to 125 kilocalories, 4 to 5 grams fiber, about 400 milligrams
            potassium,
            17 milligrams calcium, 36 milligrams phosphorus and traces of other minerals like iron,” said Professor
            Kanwar,
            an eminent biophysicist who writes for the Health Tribune.

         </p>
         <p>
            A major study reveals that diets loaded with potassium-rich bananas may be able to cut the risk of strokes
            by
            one-third. Scientists feel that many people can be protected against strokes and heart attacks by minimizing
            sodium (common salt) intake and by consuming plenty of potassium-rich foods of which banana is one. In the
            United States, the Food and Drug Administration has just allowed the banana industry to make official claims
            for the fruit’s ability to reduce the risk of high-blood pressure and stroke.

      <h3 id="citrus">4.Citrus fruits</h3>
      <img src="img/citrus.img" alt="citrus fruits">
      <div class="text">
         <p>
            Citrus fruits. The overflowing amounts of vitamin C in citrus fruits are the reason they are included in the
            list. “Locally, we have calamansi, suha and dalandan. However, oranges and lemons are splendid, too, but are
            more costly,” Ong wrote.
         </p>

         <p>
            Vitamin C may help alleviate inflammatory conditions like asthma, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
            It
            also protects the heart and boosts the immune system. That’s why it’s good for preventing colds.
         </p>

         <p>
            “Citrus fruits contain a fair amount of folate and potassium,” Ong said. “Folate lowers homocysteine levels
            in
            the body and may reduce heart disease. All citrus fruits contain fiber, especially in the membranes
            separating
            the sections. For that reason, when you eat a fresh orange or grapefruit, it is always best to try to eat a
            bit
            of the white membrane around the juicy sections of the fruit.”
         </p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="coconut">5.Coconut</h3>
      <img src="img/coconut.img" alt="coconut">
      <div class="text">
         <p>
            Coconut. Although not actually a fruit but a nut, Dr. Ong included this on the list. Sugar from coconut is
            all
            natural. That is why it is recommended to people with diabetics. Studies have shown that it has a low
            glycemic
            index (GI) of 35, which is much lower than the 54 GI, which nutritionists consider as safe for people who
            have
            to watch their blood glucose level. “It has also glumatic acid, the same ingredient present in Viagra,” says
            Benjamin Lao, president of Lao Integrated Farms Inc., based in Bansalan, Davao del Sur.
         </p>

         <p>
            One American health magazine hails coco water as “America’s healthiest beverage” for providing enhanced
            hydration, essential nutrition and all five essential electrolytes (calcium, potassium, magnesium,
            phosphorus
            and sodium).
         </p>

         <p>
            When compared with a popular sports drink per 100 milligrams, coco water has more potassium (294 milligrams
            versus 11.7 milligrams), less sodium (25 milligrams versus 41 milligrams), more chloride (118 milligrams
            versus
            39 milligrams), more magnesium (10 milligrams versus 7 milligrams), and less sugars (5 milligrams versus 6
            milligrams).

      <h3 id="grapes">6.Grapes</h3>
      <img src="img/grapes.img" alt="grapes">
      <div class="text">
         <p>
            Grapes. In the Bible, grapes were made into wine. Winifred Walker wrote in All the Plants of the Bible:
            “These
            bunches of grapes were thrown into a wine press, which was sometimes as large as a room and constructed
            underground, then trodden under foot by laborers. The juice of the squeezed grapes was made into wine and
            vinegar: this vinegar was poor wine, chiefly the drink of the Roman soldiers.”

         </p>
         <p>
            According to Ong, grapes contain important ingredients such as tannins, flavonoids and anthocyanins. “These
            chemicals are believed to give grapes their anticancer properties,” he wrote. “Grapes are beneficial for
            those
            recuperating from an illness, and those who have anemia and fatigue. In fact, during Mahatma Gandhi’s long
            fasts, he would drink grape juice to keep his strength up.”
         </p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="papaya">7.Papaya</h3>
      <img src="img/papaya.img" alt="papaya">
      <div class="text">
         <p>
            Papaya. “Low in calories and full of nutrition, papaya has more vitamin C than an orange,” said Amy Tousman,
            a
            registered dietitian based in Hawaii. “It’s loaded with vitamin A, potassium, folate and fiber. It also
            contains lutein and zeaxanthin, substances which help protect our eyes from age-related blindness.”
         </p>

         <p>
            Papaya helps in the prevention of atherosclerosis, diabetes and heart disease. Folic acid found in papaya is
            needed for the conversion of a substance called homocysteine, an amino acid. If unconverted, homocysteine
            can
            directly damage blood vessel walls and if levels get too high, it is considered a significant risk factor to
            heart attack and strokes.
         </p>

         <p>
            Papaya is definitely a boon when it comes to the heart. The antioxidants fight the cholesterol present in
            the
            blood and prevent it from building into plaques that clog the arteries. Apart from that, the rich fiber
            content
            of the fruit breaks down toxic substances like the homocysteine into easily absorbable amino acids, reducing
            chances of heart stroke.
         </p>

         <p>
            Papaya is also a good source of fiber, which lowers cholesterol levels and helps in easing the discomforts
            of
            constipation. The fiber is able to bind to cancer toxins in the colon and keeps them away from the healthy
            colon cells.
         </p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="pinneaple">8.Pinneaple</h3>
      <img src="img/pinneaple.img" alt="pinneaple">
      <div class="text">
         <p>
            Pineapples are loaded with vitamins and minerals including vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, phosphorus and
            potassium. It is also rich in fiber and calories. On top of it all, this fruit is low in fat and
            cholesterol.
         </p>

         <p>
            Since pineapples are rich in vitamin C, they can fight off viruses that cause cough and colds. Even when you
            are already infected with such ailment, pineapples can help you, health experts claim. As the fruit is
            loaded
            with bromelain, it is effective in suppressing coughs and loosening mucus.
         </p>

         <p>
            If you have a cold with a productive cough, add pineapple to your diet. It is commonly used in Europe as a
            post-operative measure to cut mucous after certain sinus and throat operations. Those individuals who eat
            fresh
            pineapple daily report fewer sinus problems related to allergies.
         </p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="strawberry">9.Strawberry</h3>
      <img src="img/strawberry.img" alt="strawberry">
      <div class="text">
         <p>
            “Strawberries are an excellent source of vitamin C,” said Toronto-based registered dietitian Madeleine
            Edwards.
            Most mammals—except for human beings—have the ability to produce vitamin C naturally, which is why it’s so
            important to get your daily requirement. “One serving of strawberries contains 51.5 mg of vitamin C—about
            half
            of your daily requirement,” Edwards said. “Double a serving to one cup and get 100 percent.”
         </p>

         <p>
            Vitamin C is a well-known immunity booster, as well as a powerful, fast-working antioxidant. A 2010 study of
            University of California at Los Angeles discovered that the antioxidant power in strawberries becomes
            “bioavailable” or “ready to work in the blood” after eating the fruit for just a few weeks.

         </p>
         <p>
            Nutritionists said strawberries are packed with vitamins B2, B5, B6, and K, copper and magnesium. They also
            contain folate, a key ingredient in the manufacture of red blood cells. Strawberries, likewise, contain
            omega
            fatty acids and essential fiber.
         </p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="watermelon">10.Watermelon </h3>
      <img src="img/watermelon.img" alt="watermelon">
      <div class="text">
         <p>
            Packed with some of the most important antioxidants found in nature, it is an excellent source of vitamin C
            and
            a very good source of vitamin A, particularly through its concentration of beta-carotene. Food experts
            recommend watermelon as a very good source of vitamin B6 and a good source of vitamin B1 and magnesium.
            Because
            of its higher water content and calorie value, it is ranked more valuable than other fruits.
         </p>

         <p>
            Ong said every two cups of watermelon (280 grams) contain 80 calories, zero fat, 27 grams of carbohydrates,
            10
            milligrams of sodium, 80 micrograms of vitamin A, lots of vitamin B2, 80 milligrams of vitamin C, 18
            milligrams
            of lycopene, and ample amounts of potassium, iron and calcium.
         </p>

         <p>
            The water in the fruit is said to be made of 92-percent pure alkaline water. “Compared to acidic juices of
            oranges and pineapple [which may irritate people with ulcer and gastritis], watermelon is safe for your
            stomach,” Ong said.
