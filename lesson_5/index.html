         <p>This quote is by Dalai Lama XIV from one of his many writings.</p>

         <p>The big idea here is understand that we really need to focus on being happy from an internal loci of
            control.</p>

         <p>Here’s how this applies to us and self-improvement:</p>


         <ul>
            <li>They say happiness is a pursuit and not a destination. That is correct.</li>
            <li>
               They say we should strive for joy on a day to day basis and not suffer on a daily basis with the
               expectation
               that one day you will be happy. That is also correct.
            </li>
            <li>
               But attaining that state of joy or happiness or whatever you want to call it, is your responsibility. You
               have
               to be accountable for it. You cannot let happiness come to you. You have to live your life in a way that
               brings
               you joy.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>So, let’s put this into action:</p>

         <ul>
            <li>
               Stop complaining that the circumstances responsible for your happiness are not under your control. Don’t
               fall
               for the victim mentality.
            </li>
            <li>
               Once you understand that however bad your current situation is you can start to take control, i.e. come
               up with
               a plan to become happy.
            </li>
            <li>You will fail, at least initially, but you will get up, dust the failure off, and try again.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Hey, by the way…</p>
         <p>
            If you’re one of the people who are determined to make a change who is sincere about wanting to really make
            this work for you, I’d like to invite you to leave a comment below and share what you think about this
            quote.

         I'm SPAN <br>

         The purpose of life is to be happy <br>


         By His Holiness the Dalai Lama <br>


         The basic source of all happiness is a sense of kindness and warm-heartedness towards others. We are all the
         same as human beings. We are born the same way, we die the same way, and we all want to lead happy lives. <br>


         The key to happiness is peace of mind. This is not something that can be bought. Inner peace has to be
         cultivated by each of us from within. All our religious traditions, despite whatever philosophical
         differences
         there may be among them, carry the same message of love and warm-heartedness that is the foundation of such
         peace of mind. <br>

         I sometimes wish that we were more like children, who are naturally open and accepting of others. Instead,
         as
         we grow up, we fail to nurture our natural potential and our sense of fundamental human values. We get
         caught
         up in secondary differences and tend to think in terms of 'us' and 'them'. Education can change this. We
         need
         to learn to distinguish the destructive nature of emotions like anger, fear and attachment, which disturb
         our
         peace of mind, from the positive qualities of compassion that are genuine sources of happiness. <br>


         I often ask myself what the purpose of life is. I conclude that it is to be happy. We have no guarantee of
         what
         will happen in the future, but we live in hope, which is what keeps us going. There is sometimes
         insufficient
         understanding of the difference between sensory consciousness and mental consciousness. The ultimate source
         of
         happiness a mental feeling of joy, and not a wealth of material goods. The sensory pleasure material things
         provide is generally short-lived. Such satisfaction does little to allay anxiety and fear. On the other
         hand,
         mental joy sustains itself. <br>

         Nowadays scientists too agree that our basic human nature is compassionate and warm-hearted because that is
         the
         way our lives begin. Without our mother's love and affection we would not have survived. Since we depend on
         other human beings for our own happiness, it is natural to feel warm-hearted towards them. Human beings are
         responsive. No matter how beautiful a flower may be, it won't react to my smile. But if I smile at another
         human being, she or he generally smiles in return, and even animals react positively. <br>


         Today, the world is mostly focussed on external development. However, ancient Indian traditions emphasize
         looking within to find the real source of joy. To be happy it is our minds we must transform. This is the
         basis
         of the longstanding traditions of ahimsa, doing no harm, and karuna, wishing others to be free from
         suffering. <br>

         Compassion, an active concern for others' well-being, is not only part of religion, it also belongs to our
         lives as human beings. From compassion we develop self-confidence; that brings inner strength, allowing us
         to
         act with transparency and candour. If a person is happier, his or her family is happier; if families are
         happy,
         neighbourhoods and nations will be happy. By each of us working to transform ourselves, we can change our
         human
         way of life and make this a century of compassion. <br>

         We must continually consider the oneness of humanity, remembering that we all want to be happy. And indeed,
         everyone has a right to a happy life. Along the way we may be faced with problems, but we must not lose
         hope.
         We must keep up our determination without being impatient to achieve quick results. <br>


         If you agree with anything I have written here, I hope you will follow it up in your day to day lives. As I
         have said before, if you want others to be happy, practise compassion, if you want to be happy, practise
         compassion.
